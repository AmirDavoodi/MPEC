# MPEC Programming Test - Candidate Package

Welcome to the MPEC (Mathematical Proof Explanatory Chain) programming test!

## 📋 Your Task

Implement a fullstack TypeScript application that processes mathematical content and creates knowledge graphs with explanatory chains.

## 📁 Package Contents

- **`programming_test_instructions.pdf`** - Main test instructions and requirements
- **`sample_latex_content.md`** - Sample LaTeX mathematical content to work with
- **`mock_api_responses.json`** - Mock API responses for your backend implementation
- **`typescript_interfaces.ts`** - TypeScript interface definitions
- **`README.md`** - This file

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read the Instructions**: Start with the PDF instructions document
2. **Review Sample Content**: Check the sample LaTeX content and mock responses
3. **Set Up Projects**: Create NestJS backend and Next.js frontend projects
4. **Implement Features**: Follow the three-step workflow described in the instructions
5. **Test and Document**: Ensure everything works and write clear setup instructions

## 🎯 What You'll Build

- **Backend API**: 3 REST endpoints with mock OpenAI integration
- **Frontend Interface**: Responsive web app with graph visualization
- **Core Workflow**: Course pattern extraction → Example analysis → Test solving

## 💡 Key Points

- **No OpenAI API Key Required**: Use the provided mock responses
- **No Database Setup**: Use in-memory storage
- **Focus on Core Features**: Get the main workflow working first
- **Be Creative**: Show your skills in graph visualization and UI design

## 📊 Evaluation Focus

- Functionality (30%): All features work correctly
- Code Quality (25%): Clean, well-structured TypeScript
- UI/UX Design (20%): Responsive, intuitive interface
- Graph Visualization (15%): Creative and effective
- Technical Implementation (10%): Error handling, testing, docs
