Proof by Induction: Sum of the First \( n \) Natural Numbers

The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:
\[
    1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

\section{Answer}
Consider the sum of the first $n$ numbers:
\begin{equation}
    1+2+ \ldots + n.
\end{equation}
Now, let us write the sum from $n$ to $1$:
\begin{equation}
    n+n-1+ \ldots + 1.
\end{equation}
The sum of both sequences is the same; the only difference is the order of the addition. Next, add the first element of the first sequence to the first element of the second sequence, which is $(1+n)$. Do the same for each of the two elements of both sequences. The result is the following:
\begin{equation}
    (1+n), (2+(n-1)), \ldots, (n+1).
\end{equation}
