\section{Theorem}

Let $a, b$ be two odd integers. The form of an odd integer is the following:
\begin{center}
    $a$ is odd if and only if $a = 2k+1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{center}

We need to show that, $a+b$ is an even integer, if $a$ and $b$ are odd integers.

\section{Proof}

Let $a$ and $b$ be two odd integers. Then, with no loss of generality, $a= 2m+1$ and $b=2n+1$, for $m, n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Then, the sum is the following:
\begin{center}
    $2m+ 2n+2 = 2(m+n+1).$
\end{center}
However, $2(m+n+1)$ is a form of an even integer because the integers are closed under addition, or

\begin{center}
    $m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \to m+n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{center}
