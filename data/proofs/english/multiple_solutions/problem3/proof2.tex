\section{Question:}

Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.

\section{Answer:}

Suppose $\sqrt{2}$ were rational, meaning $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ for some integers $p$ and $q$ with no common factors. Squaring both sides gives:
\begin{equation}
    p^2 = 2q^2.
\end{equation}

In prime factorization, $p^2$ has an even number of factors, and $2q^2$ has an odd number of factors of $2$. This contradiction shows that $p^2$ cannot equal $2q^2$, proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
