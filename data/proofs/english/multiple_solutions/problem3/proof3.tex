\section{Question:}

Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.

\section{Answer:}

Suppose $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, so $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ in lowest terms. Then:
\begin{equation}
    p^2 = 2q^2.
\end{equation}

Since $p^2$ is even, $p$ is even, so we write $p = 2k$. Substituting:
\begin{equation}
    (2k)^2 = 2q^2 \Rightarrow 4k^2 = 2q^2 \Rightarrow q^2 = 2k^2.
\end{equation}

Thus, $q^2$ is even, meaning $q$ is also even. This creates an infinite descent of smaller and smaller even numbers, contradicting the assumption that $p$ and $q$ are in lowest terms. Hence, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
