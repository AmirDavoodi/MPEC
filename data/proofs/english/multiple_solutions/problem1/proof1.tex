\section{Question:}

Prove that the sum of two even integers is always even.

\section{Answer:}

Let $a$ and $b$ be two even integers. By definition, an even integer can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    a = 2m, \quad b = 2n, \quad \text{where } m, n \text{ are integers}.
\end{equation}

The sum of $a$ and $b$ is:
\begin{equation}
    a + b = 2m + 2n.
\end{equation}

Factoring out $2$:
\begin{equation}
    a + b = 2(m + n).
\end{equation}

Since $m + n$ is an integer, we conclude that $a + b$ is even.
